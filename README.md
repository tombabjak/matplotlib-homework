Look across all previously generated figures and tables and write at least three observations or inferences that can be made from the data. Include these observations at the top of notebook.

1. There was a strong, positive correlation between a mouse's weight and average tumor volume in the Capomulin trials (heavier mice tended to have larger tumors).

2. Data taken from male and female mice was about even, with only a 1.2% difference between the two sets.

3. Of the four specified drug regimens, Capomulin and Ramicane had the least average tumor volumes with less variance, likely making them the better treatment options over Infubinol and Ceftamin.
